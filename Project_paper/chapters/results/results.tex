\chapter{Results} \label{ch:results}


The section is dedicated to the results of this project. Figure \ref{fig:winrate_graph} shows the average winrate graph of all agents. The agent has trained in 150 games, and 15 epochs. The performance is evaluated after every 4 training games. The amount of performance games is therefore $150/4 = 37$ games.

Figure \ref{fig:discounted_returns} shows the discounted returns of all three agents.
