\chapter{Task: Training scheme} \label{ch:Dominion_engine}
For this section, the general training structure will be discussed. This training scheme serves the purpose of training the agent, such that its value function will converge at an optimal policy. The training scheme will be the same for all agents, and will be discussed in the following sections.

\section{Training structure}
The agents were trained on an epsilon greedy agent with a value function that was randomly initiated. If the agent won 10 games in a row, then it would mean, that the agent had learned to beat the given opponent, and that a stronger opponent would challenge the agent more. Therefore, if the agent won 10 games in a row, then all the weights that the agent had trained would be transferred to the test player. The agent therefore had to find a method for beating the strategy it just used. The game that was used to visualize all the data was used by playing the agent against random walk.
