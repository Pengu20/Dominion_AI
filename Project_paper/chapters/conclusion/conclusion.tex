\chapter{Conclusion} \label{ch:conclusion}

For this assignment, 3 different methods have been compared up against each other. The methods are Q-learning, SARSA and expected SARSA. Through evaluation of the different methods, it has been shown, that the Q-learning agent learns faster than the other agents. Furthermore, based on the evaluation difference between Q-learning with and without a target policy, it has been shown that the target neural network for, this application, shows no significant improvement in the performance of the agent.
