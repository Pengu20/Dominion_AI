In the field of natural language processing (NLP)
for robot control, it is typical to conduct
NLP on text as opposed to speech\cite{Method3}\cite{Method1}\cite{Method2}\cite{TextNotSpeech1}. 
Translating voice to text, and processing 
text is therefore usually seen as two separate problems.

Creating text from speech is usually overlooked, 
as it is such a popular field itself, that there is no benefit 
of making such a method specifically for robot control\cite{SpeechToText1}.

Processing text and parsing it into robot actions, is the main problem that 
will be addressed in this project.

A related paper is published, where the workflow for their natural language processing 
is by using a pre-built voice-to-text system based on pythons "SpeechRecognition" 
created by Google. The processing afterwards comprises an algorithm that detects 
any actionable commands within the text. With such a system and 
the use of robot vision, they were able to pick and place objects only using 
voice commands\cite{Method1}.

Another work that was done used a recurrent neural network to map text to 
predefined actions, such that the robot could learn what commands the 
sentences had\cite{Method3}.

Using neural networks has been a great success in the field of natural language 
processing\cite{NN_rocks}\cite{vaswani2017attention}\cite{devlin2018bert}. Almost all mentioned papers, makes use of neural networks 
in some way\cite{Method1}\cite{Method2}\cite{TextNotSpeech1}. 
Therefore, it will also be the main method used to solve the problem given 
in this bachelor project.
