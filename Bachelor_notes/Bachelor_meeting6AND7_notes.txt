Bachelor meeting 6 and 7

antecedent pronoun parsing?



Rapport feedback:

 - start from transformers (mindfull of time, space and narrative)

 - points will be given for how the theory is implemented, not arbitrary theory

 - introduction to theory segments: to large, not going to work (example: NLP introduction cool)

 - better use of my time to think about evaluation and about testing the limit of my system and improve.


managing transforming use tools.

next week: 
implement kinematics in the parser, and get ideas to how it could be implemented, which is then used

idea: move to a frame, save frame as "name". add it to transform manager. Ask it to make movements based on that frame.

core idea: must need to relate to other subjects that i have. too show that i learned something through the bachelor course.
